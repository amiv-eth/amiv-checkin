    <h1>AMIV Privacy Statement</h1>
    <br/>
    <h3>AMIV Checkin App</h3>
      <p>Data is only ever collected from active user input, never passively or in the background. No pictures are saved
      from the camera. The camera is only used to detect barcodes and is only active when the camera preview is
      displayed on-screen within the app. The barcodes or user text input will be sent to a secure AMIV server where
      they are used for tracking event attendance of persons registered at the ETH only. If the sent data does not
      correspond to any person registered at the ETH then the data is discarded. No data is collected which is
      unrelated to the functionality of the app. The data is not shared with any third parties. The data is purely
      used by entitled members of the AMIV. If you would prefer not to have this data shared with the AMIV servers,
      please uninstall the app or do not open/use the app. There is no way to prevent the data being sent to AMIV
      servers as this is the core functionality of the app. Whereby AMIV represents the 'Akademische Maschinen- und
      Elektro-Ingenieur Verein' at the ETH Zurich.</p><br/>
